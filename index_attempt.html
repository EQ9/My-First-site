<p>I am currently learning to code with <a href="https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/">Code First Girls</a>. Going over everything from how the
internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...</p>

<p><li type="1">You can understand what is going on 'under the hood'
<br><li type="1">Not have to rely on someone else for a quick prototype website!
<br><li type="1">It's fun!</p>

<h2><i>What do you need to create a website?</i></h2>

<p>Not much!</p>
<p><li>A computer (always a good start)
<br><li>A text editor (I am using atom)
<br><li>A web browser (I am using chrome)
<br><li>Some HTML, CSS and JS files</li></p>

<p>Follow my progress on <a href="https://github.com/">github</a></p>
